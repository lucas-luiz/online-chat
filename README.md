# Online Chat
## With Express and Socket.io

This project simulates an online chat, but in localhost, with different tabs being different users. 
Messages are saved until the server is restarted, if the tabs are restarted the messages remain.
I used Socket.io for the real time updating and Express.js for the http requests.
